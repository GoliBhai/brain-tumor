Brain Tumor Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based diagnostic tool to predict whether a patient is likely to have a brain tumor, based on clinical symptoms and diagnostic features. 
It uses a Random Forest Classifier, a robust and interpretable algorithm suitable for tabular data and medical applications.

Model Used:
a. Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn
b. Chosen for its accuracy, interpretability, and ability to handle both categorical and numerical data
c. Trained from scratch every time the script is run (no dependency on pre-saved .pkl model files)
